# Open Data Projects
I am currently working on Open Data Projects in my free time.

### Busfumes  

Scraping tweets & bus estimates, mixing realtime/static data to inform the
public about what our busses are doing. In collaboration with @cww9989 and
@iambchan.

### FSA Data Visualization 
As part of Open Data Day 2014, @louiedinh and I built a visualization of the
Foundation Skills & Assessment Scores dataset made available by the Gov't of
BC. We're making this data available for parents & educators alike.

## Other Stuff
I have varying levels of experience working on Ruby/Rails, Python/Django,
Java/Spring, Scala/Play, PHP/CodeIgniter projects.

I work professionally as a Software Developer. I prefer working with the keyboard because I enjoy jumping around quickly, ...

Here are the apps I configure for maximum productivity:

### Learn Basic Emacs Keybindings

I use a mac, and the emacs keybindings are really good because they're useful in all apps.

The following keys are indispensible

- ctrl-n
- ctrl-p
- ctrl-b
- ctrl-f
- meta-b
- meta-f
- ctrl-k
- ctrl-y

These keys work in text fields for most text editors, terminals, and web browsers.

### Learn Mac Keybindings

For non-tech apps, these are the most useful
- meta-left-arrow
- meta-right-arrow
- ctrl-left-arrow
- ctrl-right-arrow

- cmd+shift+/ -- pulls up the search dialog
- cmd+{  navigates tabs 
- cmd+}  navigates tabs

- cmd-tab navigate apps
- cmd-`   navigate windows in an app

### iTerm/Terminal for effectiveness

I bind `opt+` to pull up a terminal anywhere. Harkens back to counter strike days

- cmd+{  navigates tabs 
- cmd+}  navigates tabs
- cmd+1,2,3,4 to switch to tab
- cmd+d to split horizontal
- cmd+shift+d to veritcal split
- cmd+shift+e to show timestamps

Also see "Learn Basic Emacs Keybindings". These apply to iTerm.

I do a lot of scrappy analysis using shell scripts. I recommend mastering these tools:

- less (to read documentation)
- pipes
- jq
- curl
- wc
- uniq
- cut
- awk/sed

### Spectacle/Rectangle

I don't need fancy windows management, I mainly need to organize pages
left/right quickly, often in 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 and full sceren. Rectangle/Spectacle suffice.

I bind only use these keybindings

- cmd-opt-h for cycle left side of screen
- cmd-opt-l for cycle right side of screen
- cmd-opt-j for middle 1/3rd
- cmd-opt-k for fullscren

### Emacs

Emacs is like an instrument. It's a lifelong learning process tuning for
productivity. These days I use spacemacs because I'm pretty happy with layers
over curating individual plugins. It also allows me to help junior engineers
ramp up quickly with Emacs.

Things I use Emacs for (that are not tied to a specific programming language)

- magit :: Unbelievably productive git client
- org-mode :: I have a git repository setup to track tasks and manage my priorities
- smartparens :: Effectively copy/pasting

# Thoughts

> Algorithms generally concern with values, 
> indexes are an implementation detail


> Could we have uesd iterators?
    - no, mutates state (like advanceCounters())
        - need to consume the current & next element
          unless we want to store it with mutable lists

> Can we use functional paradigms for everything?
    - Makes sense on the algorithmic level, does not go 
      with Domain Driven Design for integrating components

# Implementation
================

Functional: 
    - behaves like pseudo code & reads like it!
    - methods succintly describe behavior

Imperative: 
    - need to track counters... lots of counters
    - for loops... for (almost) everything :(
    - return codes or exceptions to exit while loop
        - pick your poison

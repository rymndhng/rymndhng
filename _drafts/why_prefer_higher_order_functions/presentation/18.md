# Last Thoughts

> Write Code That Hints At What It Does:
    - instead of `for` loop, use fold/map/filter/exists ...
    - every for loop -> 1 liner

> Instead of language primitives, we're only using
> functions
    `myList.par.map(_.ts)` vs `myList.map(_.ts)`

> Sequences can be infinite - traditional for loops can't
    stream = Request.get("twtr.com/stream", stream=True)
    for(line in stream.items()):    // forever
        print line

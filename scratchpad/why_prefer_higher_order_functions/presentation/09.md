# Functional Constructs

Scala Collections Abridged
```scala
// Actual trait is called `TraversableLike`
trait Seq[T] {
    def head: T                 // these two behave like
    def rest: Seq[T]            // a linked list
    def map(f: T => B): Seq[B]
    def filter(p: T => Boolean): Seq[T]
    def fold(D, f:(D, T) => D): D
}
```

**Wherever you get a sequence, you can chain them**
Note: _Fold_ isn't on this list, but it's probably the
most important

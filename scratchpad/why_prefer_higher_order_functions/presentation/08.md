# Scala Stuff

- type inference
    + `val x = 5` vs `val x:Int = 5`

- Closures (Real Functions)
    + `items.filter(x:String => x == "None")`
    + `items.filter(_ == "None")`

- Compile Time Checking of Tail Recursion

- Sane Defaults
    + Case Classes
    + Immutable Data Structures
    + No Null, Has Empty Lists

- Destructuring (convert sequences or objects into vals)
